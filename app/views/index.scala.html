        Once you're convinced, go on and create an account. Once you do, you'll
        be able to use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) endpoint, as well as
        register your own applications, which can then use the Breakpoint API.

      <p>Here's what a typical request to the API looks like:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">{
  "language": "php",
  "code": "&lt;?php
              echo \"This is a test\";
           ?&gt;"
}</pre>
      <p>
        Pretty straightforward, eh? You can, of course, tweak some more options.
        Check out our documentation for a full list of options, but for many
        languages, the above is all you need to do.
