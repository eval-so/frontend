      <h2>Why Eval.so?</h2>
      <p>
        Eval.so provides a free and open source web platform for you to evaluate
        code in many situations. Whether you want to make sure your code works
        on another computer, or you found some code online that you don't trust,
        simply run it on Eval.so, and have your answer in no time.

      <h2>Where should I use it?</h2>
      <p>
        We'll leave that up to you! Eval.so prvodes an very simple JSON API.
        You can develop programs and websites that interact with the API, or
        take advantage of already-written programs that do. We also have an
        official command-line app that you can try out, which was written so
        that we have an application to use the API against, as we develop it.

        <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to <strong>use a program</strong> that integrates with
          the API, simply download the program and use it. As of right now,
          the API doesn't require any form of authentication, so programs
          should "just work."

          Eval.so is a community-driven open source project. If there's
          something you'd like to see added, file an issue on the appropriate
          GitHub project, and discuss it amongst the community. We also gladly
          accept most patches, so feel free to hack on the codebase.

          The two main parts of the project currently are the
          <a href="https://github.com/eval-so/frontend">Frontend</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/eval-so/minibcs">minibcs</a>, the backend.
          The <a href="https://github.com/eval-so/cli">command-line tool</a> is
          also open source. Check out the
          <a href="#">internals</a> page for an overview of how the system
          works.
