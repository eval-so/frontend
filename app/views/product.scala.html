    <p>
      Breakpoint is a new, open source <i>code evaluation</i> platform.
      This means that you can run code against our infrastructure in
      various ways in order to demonstrate how code works in a large number of
      languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      We provide a simple-to-use JSON interface, which allows you to throw code
      at our servers and get a result almost instantly. Our platform is
      distributed, meaning that we can easily add servers to always keep
      Breakpoint as fast as possible.

    <h1 class="nomargin">How it works</h1>
    <p>
      <!-- BUZZWORDS! -->
      We use a unique set of technologies to provide a stable, scalable platform
      that is always ready when you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of our platform is our officially supported API clients. We
      offer officially supported clients in Clojure, Scala, Ruby, Python,
      JavaScript and PHP. But don't fear, making clients for other languages is
      easy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next level of the platform is what the API client connects to: Our
      web tier. The web stack is a simple <a href="http://playframework.org/">
      Play! 2.0</a> application, written in Scala. When a JSON request hits the
      web application, it does some validity checking to ensure that you're a
      valid user and that the request is sane. Afterwards, it transforms the
      request into a Scala object, and sends it off to our
      <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the request hits Akka, it gets forwarded to the
      <a href="https://github.com/breakpoint-eval/bcs">Breakpoint Compilation
      System</a>, or "BCS." BCS creates an <a href="http://selinuxproject.org/">
      SELinux</a> Sandbox, which is unique to the evaluation being done. BCS
      tells the sandbox how to process the request, and waits for its response.
      If it receives a response within the preset time limit, it sends another
      Scala object, (an <code>EvaluationResponse()</code> object), as a message
      back up to Akka, which forwards it to the web tier, and finally back to
      the client. If, however, no response is received, we kill the sandbox and
      send a <code>EvaluationTimeout()</code> message back to Akka. The web tier
      handles this as an error condition and informs the user of the timeout.

    <h1 class="nomargin">How we're different</h1>
    <p>Well, for one, we exist. ;)</p>
    <p>
      There's not a whole lot of code evaluation platforms out there, and
      certainly no open source ones. But the technology exists to make a really
      nice platform, and we've decided to harness the power of it to create
      something we're proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakpoint sets out to be a very community-centric, fast-paced project.
      With this comes challenges. We need to work out the best technology to
      use, get volunteers to help with upkeep, and be able to trust said
      volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide a fast, unique service for free. We allow anyone to contribute
      to it, fork it for themselves, and in general, make it better. We allow
      you to choose which architecture your code runs on, while providing unique
      ways to access the result (see the list of official API clients above).
