    <p>
      Breakpoint is a new and open source code evaluation platform. Learn more
      by reading our <a href="@routes.Application.product"> Product page</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 class="nomargin">Use the platform</h1>
    <p>
      Like what you see? Sign up and grab a client to begin using the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer a command-line application to Breakpoint, as well as a large
      number of officially supported API clients that developers can use in
      their code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In using the platform, you'll be joining these fine projects who have
      also chosen Breakpoint to give their users a fast, safe tool with which
      to evaluate code:

      (insert list of projects here)
    </p>

    <h1 class="nomargin">API access</h1>
    <p>Here's what a typical request to the API looks like:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">{
  "language": "php",
  "code": "&lt;?php
              echo \"This is a test\";
           ?&gt;"
}</pre>
    <p>
      Pretty straightforward, eh? You can, of course, tweak some more options.
      Check out our documentation for a full list of options, but for many
      languages, the above is all you need to do.
